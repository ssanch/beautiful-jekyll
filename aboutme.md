My name is Salvador.

I'm interested mainly in web development. I'm passionate about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I love to read about performance and best web development practices.

I'm always curious about new tools, frameworks, tips and tricks that can improve my skills. I like tutoring, blogging and some people would probably say I'm good at asking too many questions :)

I love to listen to music and working out, so if I'm not coding I'm probably playing guitar or having a good workout.

You said JavaScript? I'm all ears :)
